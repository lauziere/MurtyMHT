# MurtyMHT
Miller, Stone, and Cox's Murty algorithm for data association in MHT.

This Python3 implementation is based heavily upon David Crouse's MATLAB code: https://github.com/USNavalResearchLaboratory/TrackerComponentLibrary.

I made changes to the code such that it will produce the K best solutions to the Z given LAP cost matrices C_z, z=1, 2, ..., Z. 

The changes were first proposed in Cox and Miller.
